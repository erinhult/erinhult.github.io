        <h1>Lender Retention at Zidisha</h1>
        <p class="lead">How can lender retention be increased for a site with fairly stable engagement patterns?</p>
        <p class="bodypar"> Maintaining a microfinance organization is not a simple task. I had the opportunity to work with the peer-to-peer microfinance organization, <a href="https://www.zidisha.org/">Zidisha</a>, on a short project as part of the Insight Data Science Fellowship, and learned a lot about the subtle balancing act required to balance lending and borrowing activity while growing the organization. <br><br>

          Zidisha was really interested to better understand what factors influence retention of their lenders. 
        <!--IMG SRC="image.gif" ALT="some text" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32-->

          Zidisha's operating assumption was that the financial performance of loans that a lender helped fund was the most important factor in whether or not lenders remain engaged with the site. They recognize that the social experience likely also contributes, but they'd never had a data-driven answer to how much impact social factors influence lending, such as interaction between borrowers and lenders through comments on application pages. <br><br>

        I'll discuss below my findings on lender retention. But investigating lender behavior led a second question, which I expect may have a bigger impact on the organization. Lenders are making more bids through the site than ever, so why are so many loan applications failing to be funded in recent months? How can Zidisha respond to this issue? Essentially, how can Zidisha move towards active management of loan inventory? Check out the <a href="https://slides.com/erinh/deck/">Slides</a> tab above for more on this issue and the solution I developed with Zidisha. <br><br>

        For background, Zidisha connects borrowers in developing countries with individual lenders around the world. Loan applications are posted on the Zidisha sites, and lenders bid enough to fill the requested total, then the loan is disbursed to the borrower. Typically many lenders contribute to an individual loan application, with lenders typically contributing amounts in the range of $5-30 each. <br><br></p>
        
        <!--p class="lead">Lender Retention at Zidisha</p-->
        <p class="bodypar"> At Zidisha, keeping a lender engaged and lending through the site could mean dozens of borrowers in developing countries have access to loans with lower interest rates, allowing them to maintain or grow new businesses. Before trying to quantify how specific factors are correlated with retention, I wanted to first understand how lenders are interacting with Zidisha. As a starting point, I made a visualization showing bidding activity at Zidisha. In the figure below, each row corresponds to an individual lender, in order of signup, and each dot represents an individual bid made by that lender, over the past 5 years.  </p>
        <IMG SRC="images/bidhistoryCol.png" ALT="So many bids, so little time!" WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=520>
        <p class="bodypar">One feature that jumps out in this image is the growth rate of lenders: after fairly steady increase from 2012-2014, there is a massive surge of lenders making their first bids in March to April of 2014, with over a thousand lenders joining on a single day. Zidisha's founder explained to me that that surge corresponded to a viral Facebook post. From the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheGoodLordAbove">big guy upstairs</a>. Turns out God on Facebook has a pretty decent following, as discussed in <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/18/facebook-god/">this Mashable piece</a>. <br><br>
        It’s clear, however, that those who joined during this period (here to for referred to as ’the Flock’) were substantially less likely to continue to make loans regularly than lenders who joined the organization before or after. While Zidisha does not track the source of lenders in their database, it’s common for users finding sites organically to have higher retention than those finding sites through campaigns. <br><br>

        It’s clear from this figure, however, that those who joined during this period (here to for referred to as ’the Flock’) were substantially less likely to continue to make loans regularly than lenders who joined the organization before or after. While Zidisha does not track the source of lenders in their database, it’s common for users finding sites organically to have higher retention than those finding sites through campaigns. <br><br>

        A few other trends emerge in this visualization:<br>
        </p>

        <ul type='disc'>
        <li align="left">Generally, lender retention is pretty stable. For lenders who do not stay engaged, the timescale of initial engagement appears to be on the scale of several weeks, rather than months. </li><br>
        <li align="left">Lender engagement, in terms of bids per month, appears to have increased since September 2013, with the exception of ‘the Flock’. </li><br>
        <li align="left">Zidisha encourages lenders to distribute their funds amongst many borrowers, and it is apparent in this figure that overall, lenders are shifting over time towards smaller bid amounts, and it appears lenders joining before March 2013 are more likely to consistently make bids of $30 or more.</li><br>
        <li align="left">Further, the density of bids greater than $30 seems to be highest in the month or two after a lender’s first bid.</li><br>
        </ul>

        <p class="bodypar">

        With this type of visualization of lending behavior, can quickly give a sense of cohort behavior and what types of trends may be worth investigating further, before diving into more detailed, quantitative analysis. <br><br>
        
        Rather than looking at the individual bid level, lending activity can be aggregated to look at retention rates by cohort. </p>
        <IMG SRC="images/wedge.png" ALT="Thanks, Jonathan Hsu!" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=300>
        <p class="bodypar">What is striking about this figure is that after making a bid in the first month, lender engagement tends to be very consistent in the months that follow. This is unusual compared with typical retention for websites or aps, which generally show gradual decrease in engagement over time. Generally, engagement is much more consistent within a cohort over time, than with the number of months since make a first bid. This suggests that engaged lenders tend to remain engaged, and Zidisha may want to focus on deeper engagement of lenders during their first month. <br><br>

        You may notice sightly lower use in months 2 and 3 after making an initial bid: generally engagement during this period is lower by 4-5 percentage points, then rising to a steady level in the following months. This initial dip in engagement is likely associated with lenders making a first bid and then lending again once that initial loan has been repaid. This indicates that notification of repayment of a lender’s initial loan may be effective at reengaging a significant number of lenders. <br><br>


        In digesting this figure, it’s important to note that cohorts joining before 2012 typically have 10 or fewer members, the majority of whom are friends and family of the organization. In more recent cohorts, 20-30% of lenders are consistently engaged.<br><br> </p>

        <p class="lead">Do personal emails from the organization’s staff increase engagement?</p>

        <p class="bodypar">
        One strategy Zidisha has been using to build a sense of connection to the organization and to encourage continued engagement is to send personal emails. Zidisha has sent emails both to users with little to no activity and to new users who had recently joined the site. The personal emails encouraged followup questions and feedback on their experience with the site, and led additional discussion with some members. This type of correspondence takes time, and so Zidisha was eager to understand what level of impact these emails had on engagement. <br><br>

        First, I looked at whether emails were effective at simulating engagement amongst the users with little to no recent activity. 956 low-activity lenders received personal emails Zidisha staff members. Did it make a difference? Yes! Sending the emails had a statistically significant impact on both engagement (making at least 1 loan bid in a 3 month period) and the amount lent. It just wasn’t a very big impact: based on this sample, sending these emails engaged an additional 5% of this group, and increased lending by $1.20 per month per lender. (Unfortunately, here there was a not a comparable control group of low-activity lenders who did not receive emails, so comparing the 3 months before and after is the best we can do). So, the takeaway here was that although the emails did have an impact, this impact is not large enough to justify the time necessary to send personal emails to inactive lenders to try and re-engage them with Zidisha. <br><br>

        What about the emails sent to new members—did those have a bigger impact on lending? For this experiment, Zidisha staff sent personal emails to new lenders joining the site between late April and August, 2014. This time, emails were only sent to about half of these 727 new lenders, so that engagement and lending levels could be compared directly with those who received the personal emails and those who didn’t. <br><br>

        Zidisha had done some initial calculations and found that lending, on average was substantially higher amongst the group that had received personal emails, and asked me to run the numbers to confirm the trend. Indeed, I found that on average, monthly lending was substantially higher amongst those who’d received the personal emails. The problem? Lending was also higher in the emailed group <b> before </b> the emails were sent. It appears that Zidisha staff were more likely to send personal emails to lenders who had previously been more active (while problematic when trying to quantify impacts, this is not that surprising—these lenders are likely to be the most valuable to the organization). <br><br>

        To reduce the impact of this bias, I re-ran the analysis, this time considering only lenders who had lent $40 per month or less between making their first loan bid and receiving (or not receiving) an email. With this cutoff, we still include about 70% of these new lenders and the mean monthly lending prior to the email experiment varies by less than 1% the two groups. When we control for pre-experiment lending levels, I found that lender engagement was similar between those who received personal emails and those who did not. However, it is more likely than not that lending is higher amongst those who received a personal email. I found that lending was about 3.5 times higher, or an increase of $8 per lender per month when compared with those who did not receive personal emails. Given the high variance in lending as well as the relatively small number of lenders in each group, however, there is about an 11% change that an increase of this size or greater could have occurred by random chance. <br><br>

        So while the experiment would need to be run longer to be more certain of the impact, it appears likely that sending personal emails is likely an effective strategy to increase lending by new members. If this increase were sustained for 6 months, the value in lending per customer would be $56 per email. If you could hire an intern at $15 per hour to write, say, 6 emails per hour, this strategy could potentially return $20 in lending for every $1 invested. An additional advantage of sending the personal emails is that it has led to engagement of lenders as volunteers with the organization, and may potentially increase lender referrals to the site. <br><br>
