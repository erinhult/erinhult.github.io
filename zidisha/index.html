        <h1>Balancing Supply and Demand at Zidisha</h1>
        <p class="lead">Insert subtitle here.</p>
        <p class="bodypar"> Maintaining a microfinance system is not a simple task. I had the opportunity to work with the peer-to-peer microfinance organization, Zidisha, on a short project as part of the Insight Data Science Fellowship. <br><br>

          Zidisha was really interested in what influences retention of their lenders. 
        <!--IMG SRC="image.gif" ALT="some text" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32-->

          Their operating assumption was that financial performance of the loans they helped fund was the most important factor in whether or not lenders remain engaged with the site, but they'd never had a data-driven answer to how much impact social factors influence lending, such as interaction between borrowers and lenders through comments on application pages. <br><br>

        I'll discuss first what I found on lender retention, but investigating lender behavior led a second question, which I expect may have a bigger impact on the organization. Lenders are making more bids through the site than ever, so why are so many loan applications failing to be funded in recent months? How can Zidisha respond to this issue? I'll walk through this issue and the solution I developed with Zidisha [ADD LINK TO SECTION]. <br><br>

        For background, Zidisha connects borrowers in developing countries with individual lenders around the world. Loan applications are posted on the Zidisha sites, and lenders bid enough to fill the requested total, then the loan is disbursed to the borrower. Typically many lenders contribute to an individual loan application, with lenders typically contributing amounts in the range of $5-30 each. <br><br></p>
        
        <p class="lead">Lender Retention at Zidisha</p>
        <p class="bodypar"> At Zidisha, keeping a lender engaged and lending through the site could mean dozens of borrowers in developing countries have access to loans with lower interest rates, allowing them to maintain or grow new businesses. Before trying to quantify how specific factors are correlated with retention, I wanted to first understand how lenders are interacting with Zidisha. As a starting point, I made a visualization showing bidding activity at Zidisha. In the figure below, each row corresponds to an individual lender, in order of signup, and each dot represents an individual bid made by that lender, over the past 5 years.  </p>
        <IMG SRC="images/bidhistoryCol.png" ALT="So many bids, so little time!" WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=520>
        <p class="bodypar">One feature that jumps out in this image is the growth rate of lenders: after fairly steady increase from 2012-2014, there is a massive surge of lenders making their first bids in March to April of 2014, with over a thousand lenders joining on a single day. Zidisha's founder explained to me that that surge corresponded to a viral Facebook post. Who's post? Turns out it was the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheGoodLordAbove">big guy upstairs</a>. Turns out God on Facebook has a pretty decent following, as discussed in <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/18/facebook-god/">this Mashable piece</a>. </p>
